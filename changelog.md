# ImageSet Changelog

- `1.0.0-beta1` (2017/01/02)
  - **Improved JavaScript Code:** Switched from SVG filters to canvas for better-looking blur effect and better cross-browser compatibility. Also seems to offer better scrolling-performance.
  - **SVG support:** ImageSet will not crash any more, if source image is an SVG file but instead print a basic ImageSet without placeholder.
  - **XHTML-compatible Output** can now be configured using the `output.xhtml` setting.
  - **Transparency:** Placeholders now work properly with images, that have alpha transparency.
  - **Readability:** `imageset.php` snippet is way more readable now.

- `1.0.0-alpha1` (2016/12/09)
  - First public release
